I used Javascript to make the titles of my various pages underline dynamically when the user
first drags their cursor over them. I used bootstrap to make my page work better for different
sized screens, and to create the accordion-style menu on my homepage.

Works cited: I used W3 schools a lot for this project, and I uses their bootstrap demo styling as a template for the styling of my homepage.
