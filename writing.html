            <h3>A Path to the Center<h4>

            </h4>Analyzing Ch'ing-yüan Wei-hsin’s Famous Quote on the Nature of Zen</h3>

            <q>Before I had studied Zen, I saw mountains as mountains and waters as waters. When I arrived at a more intimate knowledge of Zen, I came to see that mountains are not mountains and waters are not waters. But now that I have got its very substance, I am at rest, and mountains are once again just mountains, and waters are just waters.
            </q>-Ch'ing-yüan Wei-hsin
            <p></p>
            Zen master Ch'ing-yüan Wei-hsin’s seemingly paradoxical statement describes three states, each corresponding with one sentence. First, he sees the outside world as objectively real. Next, he comes to see its emptiness of inherent reality, essence, or existence. Finally, he realizes the emptiness of everything, including emptiness, and therefore he stops clinging, allowing the world to be just as it is. This concise quote, therefore, traces the master’s journey toward understanding the ultimate truth that all things are empty, yet everything is, just the same.<p></p>
            The first sentence is the most self-explanatory. Wei-hsin is describing the way that almost everyone experiences the world. People attribute objective reality to their six senses, to language, and to concepts. They feel that they are an unchanging subject, and the world a truly existent object.<p></p>
            The second line of Wei-hsin’s quote refers to his moving beyond this view, instead seeing things as fundamentally empty of inherent essence or existence. This concept, termed emptiness, was developed by Mahayana Buddhism, most famously by Madhyamika philosopher Nagarjuna. It is based upon the historical Buddha's teaching of dependent origination (pratityasamutpada). The Buddha explained dependent origination by saying “When this exists, that comes to be…When this does not exist, that does not come to be.” (Thanissaro, SN 12.61) This means that each thing exists dependent on causes and conditions; it will cease to exist if these causes are no longer present. The Buddha used dependent origination to support his concept of no-self, teaching that people mistakenly create a self from the five skandhas (aggregates) of matter, sensations, perception, formations, and consciousness. These, in turn, lack fundamental existence because they are based on causes and conditions and are therefore ever-changing. For example, without matter to observe, eyes, a brain to perceive the visual data from the eyes, recognition of that perception, and consciousness to create awareness of the whole process, no sight can arise. Each of these steps is part of the causal chain creating seeing; if one of these steps is not present, seeing stops. The Buddha said that because the skandhas lack inherent existence, his bhikkhus should regard each of them as “not mine…not what I am…not my self.” (Nanamoli, 46) Because each of the impermanent, dependently originated skandhas is not the self, the Buddha concluded that the self was an illusion.<p></p>
            In the centuries following the Buddha’s death, many Buddhist schools took this idea one step further, and sought to understand each mental arising in terms of its most fundamental building blocks, termed ‘dharmas.’ The literature dealing with this subject, called Abhidharma, is one of the three parts of the traditional Buddhist canon. Much disagreement existed surrounding the nature of dharmas. Separate schools addressed the philosophical issues created by dharma theory in varying ways. The Pudgalavada school solved it by positing a fundamental person to whom the dharmas all referred, and the Sarvastivada school went so far as to claim that all dharmas exist in three times: past, present, and future.<p></p>
            The Mahayana concept of emptiness to which Wei-hsin’s second sentence points was developed in response to these types of Abhidharma ideas. Mahayana monks, Nagarjuna chief among them, critiqued Abhidharma scholars for reifying dharmas, thereby going against the Buddha’s teaching of dependent origination. The Mahayana claimed that all dharmas were subject to dependent origination and therefore empty. This “two-fold” emptiness, they thought, was a return to the Buddha’s original teaching that all things are dependent on causes and conditions. Nagarjuna made emptiness’ total ubiquity explicit in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, stating, “There can be no element of reality [dharma] that is not interdependently originated; therefore, there can be found no element of reality whatsoever that is not empty.” (Strong, 160)<p></p>
            Nagarjuna extended this claim, applying emptiness to linguistics and the ontology of concepts. He rightly saw that words have no inherent meaning, but rather gain meaning from other words in a language. They are all dependent on each other, without an inherent essence, and therefore language is fundamentally empty. Nagarjuna made language’s emptiness clear in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, succinctly stating, “What language expresses is nonexistent.” He applied a similar critique to concepts, seeing them as attempts to impute unchanging essence onto the ever-changing world. Thus Nagarjuna and Mahayana scholars more generally concluded that concepts were also empty.<p></p>
            The fundamental emptiness inherent to all things, including language and concepts, is what Wei-hsin’s second line is talking about. The word “mountain” is empty of meaning, and so are any concepts to which the word refers. Moreover, the view of the mountain as it arises in the visual field is empty because the five skandhas are empty. Even the dharmas which create the requisite conditions for the existence of the skandhas are empty of inherent essence or existence. Because all things are conditioned, Wei-hsin rightly began to view them, in the words of the Diamond Sutra, “like a star, an optical illusion, a lamp, a mirage, dew drops, a bubble, a dream”<p></p>
            The radical emptiness conveyed by the second sentence may seem contradictory to Wei-hsin’s final sentence. This is not the case, though, because a complete application of emptiness in conjunction with lived experience leads logically to the final line, and therefore also to Zen’s ‘very substance.’ Because all concepts are empty, it logically follows that the concept of emptiness is itself empty. Nagarjuna made this explicit in the Mūlamadhyamakakārikā, stating, “'All is empty' should not be asserted, nor should 'all is not empty,' 'all is both [empty and non-empty],' nor 'all is neither [empty nor non-empty].' Each is maintained [only] in the context of conventional reality.” (Thurman, 154) Nagarjuna is saying that the only ultimate truth is that nothing, not even emptiness, has ultimate truth. Therefore the outside world is not unique in its lack of inherent essence and existence, nor is the self, nor are the skandhas, or the dharmas, or words or concepts. Even causality is just the observation of relationships between empty events and holds no inherent essence or existence. Nagarjuna makes this radical interpretation of emptiness clear in the Mulamadhyamakakarika’s first chapter, stating “Since the existence of existents devoid of self-nature is not evident, the statement: ‘When that exists, this comes to be,’ will not be appropriate.” (Kalupahana, 113) In other words, because things lack inherent essence and existence, the concept of one thing causing another, like all other concepts, fails to withstand scrutiny. Nothing has the essence of causing something else. Thus emptiness’ application comes full circle, showing even dependent origination, the concept upon which it is based, to be empty.<p></p>
            When fully applied, therefore, emptiness shows that each event is indescribable. Yet given this radical understanding of the ineffability of everything, the perceptions still arise. In the words of Wei-hsin, “the mountains are … just mountains, and waters are just waters.” The ineffable nature of all happenings is called Tathata (translated as thusness or suchness). Explaining this concept, Professor Peter Harvey wrote that thusness is something’s, “as-it-is-ness,” and further explained the concept by stating, “it is simply thus.” (Harvey, 124)<p></p>
            In Secrets of Cultivating the Mind, Zen master Bojo Chinul clarified the importance of thusness in the awakening path, writing, “in the state where all things are empty, open awareness is not obscured…Those who realize this and keep to it sit in one suchness and are immutably liberated.” (Cleary) Wei-hsin’s final sentence starts by saying “I am relaxed,” reflecting this same spirit of the realization of selflessness through thusness. This is a logical extension of thusness because everything is, despite its emptiness, and humans are a part of everything. Each person simply is, despite their fundamental emptiness, just as everything else is. There is no inherently existing cause forcing the mind to think, the eyes to see, the lungs to breathe or the heart to pump blood. These are all extensions of the same thusness. Wei-hsin is relaxed because in reaching Zen’s center, he knows that he is an empty happening like the mountain and the stream: neither objectively existent nor non-existent, but just as he is.<p></p>

            <h3>Paths to Peace</h3>
            <h4>Comparing Early Buddhism with the Hymn It is Well With My Soul</h4>
            It Is Well With My Soul is one of the most popular Christian hymns of all time. While the 19th-century hymn contains no explicit Buddhist themes, comparing the song with the Buddha’s teaching can yield valuable insights about suffering and different paths to its cessation. While both the Christianity-based worldview espoused in It Is Well and Buddha’s teachings can bring their followers peace, the former relies primarily upon trust in God to achieve this end, whereas the latter focuses on cultivating understanding of the true nature of the self and the world.
            Horatio Spafford, It Is Well’s composer, was a senior partner at a large law firm, and owned extensive real estate in the Chicago area. In 1871, the great Chicago fire burned down most of his property. In 1873, his family embarked on a trip to Europe, which Spafford was unable to attend because of zoning issues related to his business. On the return trip, the boat on which Spafford’s family was traveling sank, killing all four of Spafford’s daughters. They were ages twelve, seven, four, and one. Spafford’s wife survived, so Spafford took a boat to meet her in Europe. He composed It Is Well With My Soul on this voyage, in the same seas where his daughters drowned.
            The suffering that Spafford confronted was also of central concern to the Buddha 2,400 years prior. Rather than experiencing his businesses failing or children drowning, though, Siddhartha Gautama is said to have learned about suffering, aging, and death by seeing a sick person, an old person, and a dead person while on chariot rides beyond the walls of his palace. Both men’s experiences led them to search for a permanent escape from suffering, and their solutions, while markedly similar, are also importantly distinct.<p></p>
            Spafford’s message is distinctly Christian, but it is unique from other popular hymns. These primarily praise God and Jesus, extol the virtues of faith, or look forward longingly to great rewards in Heaven. It Is Well is a song of praise, but its emphasis is not directly on God, instead focusing on the profound joy coming from accepting whatever happens. This is evident from the first verse of the song, where Spafford wrote, “When peace, like a river, attendeth my way, When sorrows like sea billows roll; Whatever my lot, Thou hast taught me to say, It is well, it is well with my soul.” This verse also clarifies Spafford’s message; he is not saying that he expects God to prevent bad things from happening. Rather, he is praising God for allowing him to accept whatever happens in this life, no matter how unpleasant, because he knows that ultimately everything will be okay.<p></p>
            The Buddha also thought that accepting whatever happens brings peace, but advocated for non-craving, renouncement, and disillusion with the world rather than the positively phrased acceptance displayed in Spafford’s hymn. Because they do not feel ready to take this radical step, many lay Buddhists choose to primarily worship the Buddha rather than explore his teachings directly. Importantly, because these Buddhists have less time to explore the Buddha’s teachings for themselves, they tend to rely more upon faith than monks do. While these lay people are important in the religion, the Buddha’s teachings primarily focus on the monk’s path to liberation from suffering, rather than lay Buddhist life. Therefore, the rest of this paper will also focus on the path the Buddha laid out for his monks.<p></p>
            The Buddha advocated that his monks renounce the world, but this did not mean that he was against happiness. While he did advise “Be not a friend of the world,” and taught to, “Look upon the world as a bubble, look upon it as a mirage (Muller, 13.4),” this type of detachment is not mutually exclusive from enjoying life. The Buddha demonstrated this when he said, “Delightful are forests, where more worldly men find no joy. Being free of the pull of desire, Saints, who seek no worldly pleasures, find delight in such places.” (Maitreya, 7.10-13) This makes it clear that while the Buddha advocated for rejecting worldly things like material goods and social status, he thought that by not trying to possess the world, one could enjoy the best of what it has to offer, like nature, even more deeply.<p></p>
            This non-rejection is also clear in the central Buddhist doctrine of the four noble truths. These state that: all life involves suffering, desire causes suffering, when desire ceases, suffering ceases, and that the path leading to the cessation of suffering is the middle way and the holy eightfold path. Some think the four noble truths are overly pessimistic because of their focus on suffering; this is incorrect. The four noble truths offer a path toward living a life free of suffering; claiming that this type of life is possible is optimistic. Renowned Buddhist monastic, author and activist Thich Nhat Hanh made this clear when discussing why he taught the Buddhist path. He famously wrote, “Happiness is available. Please help yourself to it.” (Hanh)<p></p>
            As the four noble truths make clear, the Buddha taught that ceasing craving ends suffering. Therefore, understanding the Buddha’s definition of craving is an important step toward ending suffering. The Buddha taught that craving can be one of three types: craving for sense-pleasures, for being and becoming, or for non-being and non-becoming. The first of these is the most obvious, as are its negative effects. Anyone can recognize sense desires and their negative effects. For example, it's common knowledge that people tend to crave sugar and therefore eat too much of it, often to the detriment of their health. The harmful effects of craving for being, becoming, non-being, and non-becoming are more insidious, however, and therefore they are harder to dispel. Desires for being and becoming encompass wanting to live, in addition to desiring material success, fame, pleasure, and positive emotions. Desires for non-being and non-becoming are the opposite, including the desire to cease living, or to avoid the judgment of others, to not feel physical pain, or to not feel negative emotions. Setting aside these desires, which the Buddha thought was essential to escaping suffering, could be stated positively as accepting things as they are, or with Spafford’s famous phrase, “it is well with my soul.”<p></p>
            An emphasis on the present moment is a natural extension of the Buddha’s teachings on the extinction of craving for becoming and non-becoming. The Buddha, when queried, said that his disciples were happy because “They do not repent the past, nor do they brood over the future. They live in the present.” (Rahula, 72) This theme is also reflected in It is Well. Accepting whatever the future holds is a central theme in the entire song, but Spafford also explicitly mentions letting go of mistakes made in the past in verse 3, writing, “My sin—oh, the bliss of this glorious thought!—My sin, not in part but the whole, Is nailed to the cross, and I bear it no more, Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!”. Spafford is conveying that because God has forgiven his sins through Jesus, he is freed from the suffering associated with feelings of remorse and regret. Importantly, while Spafford required God’s forgiveness to let go of the past, the Buddha’s followers were able to achieve the same equanimity without absolution from any deity. What’s more, the Buddha encouraged his followers to look within themselves to confirm his claims, because he thought that seeing, rather than just believing, was the path to liberation. He gave his monks the radical warning, “Do not be led by tradition, or reports, …or by the idea ‘this is our teacher,’” but rather instructed them: follow teachings only “when you know for yourselves.” (Rahula, 3) An essential component of the Buddhist path to acceptance without God’s help is the doctrine of anatman (no-self), a teaching diametrically opposed to the Christian view of the soul to which Spafford subscribed.<p></p>
            The most important developer of the Christian notion of the soul was 5th-century theologian St. Augustine. He thought God was inherent to the soul, writing in his philosophical treatise Soliloquia, “God ever the same, may I know you, and may I know myself.” (Augustine, 10.27) Augustine viewed the soul as the true self. Thus, in the above quote he posits that in knowing their soul, one would also know God. A similar philosophy exists in Hinduism, specifically as developed in the Upanishads. These classic texts explicate the Hindu views of Atman, Brahman, and their equivalence. Atman is the true form of each person, an idea roughly equivalent to the Western notion of the soul. Brahman is the universe’s creator and its underlying essence. In Hinduism, these two are said to be the same. Thus, in coming to know the Atman or the true self, one also discovers Brahman.<p></p>
            While the Christian concept of God’s relation to the soul is distinct from the Hindu notions of Brahman and Atman, many similarities exist. Therefore, because Buddhism was created within a Hindu context, its same critiques of Atman map onto the Christian soul, and onto the song It Is Well With My Soul. The Buddha rejected the concept of the atman; therefore he also would have rejected the Christian conception of the soul. He instead claimed that the five skandhas (aggregates) were what people mistakenly believed was their true self. The five skandhas are the six senses (including thoughts), the recognition of those senses by the mind, the labeling of those senses as either neutral, pleasant, or unpleasant, the mind’s disposition in relation to those feelings, and finally consciousness itself. The Buddha saw that, because these appear to be stable over time, people cling to them as the self, with deleterious consequences. The Buddha claimed that through careful observation, anyone could see that “feeling is not self…perceptions are not self…formations are not self…consciousness is not self.” (Nanamoli, 46) He famously compared the five skandhas to a chariot in discourse with a king. He first established that each part of the chariot was not the chariot. Then he asked, “Is the sum total of pole, axle, wheels, chariot-body…is this the ‘chariot’?.” When the king replied “no indeed," the Buddha concluded, “apparently the ‘chariot’ is nothing but a sound!” (Stryk, 92) The Buddha is claiming that like how a chariot doesn’t have a stable identity separate from its parts, human beings don’t have a stable self separate from the ever-changing skandhas.<p></p>
            The Buddha laid out the consequences of believing in the self when he explained dependent origination. Dependent origination is the idea that everything that exists depends on something else. To explain dependent origination, the Buddha said, “When this exists, that comes to be…When this does not exist, that does not come to be.” (Thanissaro, SN 12.61) This concept explains why life, in the Buddhist view, is Dukkha (suffering); everything is impermanent because when its necessary conditions are not there, it is not there. Specifically applied to the cycle of Samsara and its attendant suffering, the Buddhist tradition explicated the principle of dependent origination using the twelvefold chain of conditioned arising. Importantly, because all things are conditioned in the Buddhist view, suffering is also conditioned. Therefore, if one could end the causes of suffering, suffering would stop. There is no first step in the chain because each step causes another. That said, explanations of the chain typically start with ignorance, putting special emphasis on this step. The Buddha taught that belief in self is one of the most pernicious forms of ignorance, which he demonstrated in the Heart Sutra, calling the end of this form of wrong-view “the most illuminating mantra, the highest mantra, a mantra beyond compare,” and concluding that this “True Wisdom…has the power to put an end to all kinds of suffering.”(Hahn, lines 43-48)) The Buddha went on to explain that ignorance (with a few intermediary steps) leads to craving, which leads to clinging, which leads to becoming, which leads to birth, which leads to aging and death. Aging and death, in turn, lead to ignorance, perpetuating the endless cycle. If one could stop the wrong view of believing in the self, they would have taken a critical step towards ending the craving that perpetuates their suffering. This makes sense intuitively because if one were able to see their selflessness, there would be no self to desire things. Ceasing desire would bring the Buddha’s promised end of suffering, and the peace described in Spafford’s hymn.<p></p>
            It Is Well With My Soul is so popular because of the profound peace that people know would come by internalizing the song’s title, that “it is well with my soul.” With belief in the self and that belief’s attendant craving, though, this type of equanimity requires blind faith in an omnipotent, omnibenevolent being who will make sure that everything will be well. After all, there are innumerable things for a self to crave or fear. As is made clear by the centrality of the soul in his hymn, Spafford was strongly conditioned to believe in the existence of his self. Therefore, to gain equanimity he required something outside of himself to trust completely. What the Buddha offered was a path to the same tranquility described in the hymn without blind faith. The Buddha taught that with the help of the Dharma, one who looks can see the suffering inherent to life, its cause, its end, and the path leading to that end, and therefore can attain the equanimity that Spafford’s hymn conveys solely through their own efforts.<p></p>

            <h3>A Comparison of Utilitarianism and Kantianism</h3>
            <p></p>
            In recent years, many moral questions have become so polarized that a good-faith discussion around policy is near impossible. Understanding these issues, and why different groups hold the opinions that they do, requires an understanding of the underlying moral theories with which people make sense of the world. As the western world becomes increasingly secular, more people are making moral judgements, and therefore political decisions, using non-religious moral theories. The two most popular such theories are Utilitarianism and Kantianism. Because of these theories’ drastically different presuppositions, their conclusions often vary widely from one another. For example, Kantianism places great emphasis on justice, whereas utilitarianism does not take it into account, focusing on overall well-being instead. Therefore, Kantians often support capital punishment while utilitarians oppose it. Because moral theories have such drastic effects on moral and even political decisions, determining the best moral theory is critically important. To this end, I will demonstrate that, while both are flawed, utilitarianism is superior to Kantianism throughout this paper.
            Determining the criteria for evaluating what makes one moral theory better than another is necessary before a comparison of two such theories can occur. When comparing moral theories, many people assume that a better moral theory is the one which aligns best with their intuitions about what is right and wrong. A moral theory would be deemed “good” if it could, through some system, deem all of the things which we think are right right, and all of the things which we think are wrong wrong. This criterion would work if everyone’s moral intuitions agreed, but this is obviously not the case. Different cultures and individuals have disparate beliefs about what is right and wrong. What’s more, even if everyone’s moral intuitions agreed, that would not necessarily make those intuitions correct. Therefore, some other standard besides what aligns with moral intuition is necessary for comparing moral philosophies.
            To determine the superiority of one or another moral theory, we should primarily evaluate which theory is true. Comparing moral theories with our baseline intuitions about what is right and wrong can give us some indication of the truth of moral theories, but this “evidence” is weak for the previously discussed reasons. A better way to determine which theory is true is to evaluate the assumptions each theory makes. If a theory were based only on facts and their logical application, that would be the best moral theory. No such theory exists, but the closer a theory is to this ideal, the better it is. Therefore, in comparing Kantianism and utilitarianism, I will primarily compare how logical it is to hold the necessary beliefs for subscribing to each moral theory. Secondarily, I will evaluate the application of each theory, because this approach, while it is less rational, also can yield important insights. I will first outline each system before I compare them.
            <p></p>
            <h3>Utilitarianism:</h3>
            <p></p>
            Utilitarianism is a moral theory which evaluates acts based on the amount of utility they bring about. It is consequentialist, meaning that it evaluates the moral value of an act based on the act’s consequences. Utilitarians define utility in different ways. Classical utilitarianism postulates that the utility which we should be optimizing is pleasure. This definition seems too narrow, so most modern utilitarians define utility in terms of human flourishing instead. This definition includes things which may not bring pleasure, but are certainly worthwhile, like having children or going for a run. An additional distinction within utilitarianism is between real and hypothetical. Some utilitarians evaluate acts based on the actual outcomes of the actions (real), while others evaluate based on the foreseeable consequences of an act (hypothetical) An example illustrating the difference is this: if someone shoots a bullet into the air and it doesn’t hit anyone, under real utilitarianism the act would not be immoral; the shooter just got lucky in avoiding a morally bad outcome. Under hypothetical utilitarianism, however, the act would be immoral because the bullet hitting someone is a foreseeable outcome of the decision to shoot the bullet into the air. This outcome would hurt human flourishing, thus hypothetical utilitarians view the act of shooting the bullet as immoral. As it is the most popular, I will evaluate hypothetical modern Utilitarianism when I compare it with the second moral theory, explained below.
            Kantianism:
            <p></p>
            Developed by 18th century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, Kantianism’s fundamental basis is that one ought to act with “good will” or the desire to do what is right. Kant viewed this fundamental precept as true because of its universally agreed upon nature; people disagree on what is right, but people do not disagree that one ought to do what is right. To Kant, an act is moral only if motivated by this desire to do the right thing; all acts besides those motivated by good will are only serving some other end. These types of acts are called hypothetical imperatives. Saying that one ought to go to the gym if they want to get stronger is not a moral question for Kant, because the act of going to the gym is not motivated by good will, but by other desires; therefore this is an example of a hypothetical imperative. Being truthful even when it will disadvantage you, however, is a moral act for Kant because not lying would be motivated by the desire to do what is right, not some other goal. For an act to be moral under Kantianism, it had to be more than just motivated by good will, however; it also needed to align with the Categorical Imperative (CI). Kant conveyed the CI two ways, the first of which was:
            “Act only according to that maxim by which you can at the same time will that it should become a universal law”
            Kant viewed people as rational, autonomous individuals and thought that, because we are rational, any action we take which is contradictory is immoral. Kant therefore applied the first formulation of the CI to any act, and thought that if that application caused a contradiction, the act was immoral. For example, to Kant, lying is universally wrong because if someone lies, then they are willing that everyone lies. If everyone were to lie, then lying would not be possible because no one would trust anyone else. Thus, to Kant, lying creates a contradiction when assessed with the CI, and therefore the universal law “do not lie” should always be followed. The second formulation of the CI can be derived from the first. It is that one should:
            “Act as to treat humanity, whether in your own person or in another, always as an end and never as only a means.”
            Treating others as only a means is immoral to Kant because every individual views themself as an end and wishes to be treated as such. Therefore, to treat others as only a means is, under the first formulation of the CI, to will that they do the same to you; a contradiction because you want others to treat you as an end. Other formulations of the CI exist, but these two are the most important and widely-cited. Now that I have briefly outlined utilitarianism and Kantianism, I will compare the two. First, I will compare how each conforms to our shared moral intuitions, then I will evaluate the assumptions that each moral theory makes.

            <h3>Align with Moral Intuitions</h3>
            <p></p>
            Both utilitarianism and Kantianism align with our moral intuitions in almost all circumstances. However, there are a couple of regularly cited exceptions where the theories lead to a conclusion that doesn’t seem like it could possibly be moral. For utilitarianism, the first such instance is the sheriff example, developed by Australian moral philosopher H.J. McCloskey. It goes as follows:
            Imagine that there are race riots over a black man raping a white woman, and that a conviction would stop the riots, saving the lifes of ten people and preventing many injuries. Utilitarianism seemingly holds that if the sheriff could bear false witness and arrest a random person, he should do it, because it would result in an increase in the flourishing of continuous creatures overall. Utilitarians argue that lying would be the wrong thing to do because over the long term it would defraud trust in the legal system, and make the world a place in which anyone could be arrested for something they didn’t do. These objections seem weak, as it is certainly possible to imagine a scenario where trust is not defrauded in the legal system, and where the act actually does increase net flourishing, making it moral under utilitarianism. This example points to an asymmetry between utilitarianism and our moral intuitions: utilitarianism does not take justice into account. We typically think that morally bad acts should hurt the actors; if this suffering doesn’t result directly from the act, we want a punishment for the bad act which ensures that ‘justice is done’. Utilitarianism, however, sees hurting someone as decreasing the overall flourishing of conscious creatures, irrespective of whether they would deserve the suffering: an important instance where Utilitarianism and “common sense” morality disagree.
            A second important instance where Utilitarianism strays from our shared moral intuitions was developed by late 20th and early 21st century philosopher David Parfit. It is best posed in the form of a question in which either option leads to a seemingly immoral conclusion. The question is whether the goal of an act under utilitarianism should be to maximize total utility or average utility. If the goal is maximizing average utility, then the logical thing to do would be to kill homeless people, people with mental health problems, and generally anyone who isn’t flourishing maximally. The most moral thing, or so the argument goes, under this view, would be to kill everyone until you’re left with only one very happy sociopath. This might not fully apply, because that one sociopath would likely not be able to optimally flourish with no one else still living, but still, the conclusion that we should kill anyone who is unhappy seems very obviously immoral. This option is so obviously wrong that any theory that advocates for it has surely gone wrong somewhere. Therefore, the other option, that we should seek total utility, is the one utilitarians must accept. This has its own problems, however. Under this view, killing the poor or sad would not be moral because every life is more valuable than some gain in well-being for a wealthy person. If logically applied, however, this view would mean that the moral thing to do is to breed as fast as possible, so as to maximize the total number of people living, thereby maximizing total utility. Some utilitarians argue that we should maximize total utility for currently living conscious creatures, and not those who might live in the future, but this solution seems weak. It is not morally acceptable to spend your money instead of saving it when you are planning on having a child just because that child is not living yet.
            These two problems: the sheriff and the total vs. average utility dilemma, seem to indicate that something is incorrect in utilitarianism’s formulation. These are not knockdown arguments proving the theory false, but, as the argument goes, if the theory leads to these conclusions, there must be something wrong with the theory. These undesirable conclusions are less seemingly immoral than those stemming from both formulations of the CI in Kantianism. The counterexample to the first formulation is the inquiring murderer example, discussed below.
            A known murderer with a bloody ax asks you where your friend is. You know where your friend is, and you know that this murderer will kill your friend if you tell the murderer where he is hiding. You could save your friend by lying to the murderer about your friend's location. Under Kantianism, you would be morally required not to lie to the murderer, even if it results in your friend’s death, because as previously discussed, lying is always immoral under Kantianism. This conclusion is seemingly untenable, yet Kant never waived from it. Instead, he argued that you should tell the truth, because if you were to lie and that lie somehow resulted in your friend’s death (say, he was running away), then you would be partly morally culpable for the murder. This is a surprising claim, and one which most modern Kantians would not agree with. Instead, many modern Kantians (or deontologists), try to make moral maxims smaller scope. For example, they might make a maxim, ‘never lie unless it will bring about some greater evil’, instead of the broader ‘never lie’. This clearly avoids the inquiring murderer problem, but points to a second, more fundamental problem with kantianism: the scope of maxims is arbitrary. Kant rightly saw that maxims which were extremely specific could not be applied under the first formulation of the CI. For example, you could not evaluate the act of giving a sandwich to the homeless man on the corner of 132nd street and Park street as a universal maxim. If everyone gave a sandwich to that one homeless person he would have far too many sandwiches, there would be horrible traffic in the entire city and there wouldn’t be enough sandwiches to buy. This is why Kantian maxims must be broad, but the question of how broad remains unanswered. Should we have thousands of small maxims, just large enough to avoid the aforementioned homeless man problem? Or, as Kant himself thought, should we have fewer? There isn’t a strong reason to choose larger or smaller scope maxims besides avoiding a conclusion which we don’t like, making the choice arbitrary; a problem for Kantianism.
            The counterexample to the CI’s second formulation pushes back on the idea that it is never acceptable to use others as ends, regardless of outcome. It asks us to imagine a parent and their baby are trapped in a crumbling building, and that a concrete block is slowly falling, and is going to crush the child. There is an unconscious person on the ground, and the only way to save the baby is to move the unconscious person’s leg so that it hold up the concrete block. This will break their foot, but it will not kill the unconscious person. Because Kantianism forbids using people as solely means, this act would be deemed immoral under the theory; the unconscious person has not given you permission to use their leg to stop the block. Both counterexamples to the CI’s formulations point out conclusions which could not possibly be moral, similarly to the three above examples for utilitarianism. There is an additional point to consider, central to both theories, beyond their baseline assumptions and applications.

            <h3>The Question of Motives:</h3>
            <p></p>
            People’s motivations for doing things are vastly complex. Even they often don’t know why they make the choices they do. Utilitarianism completely ignores intention, whereas Kantianism makes it central to the entire theory. These two approaches are polar extremes and both are flawed. Someone who volunteers just to put it on a college application is definitely not doing as good of a thing as someone who does it because they empathize with the poor and want to help. Utilitarianism views both people as equally moral; a problem with the theory. Kantianism, on the other hand, makes motivation too central and too narrowly focused. In making duty the highest motivation for moral acts, Kantianism makes selfless acts which are motivated, not by the abstract desire to do the right thing, but by love, empathy, or gratitude less moral. Pragmatically, this is a problem because these emotions are what actually cause people to do good things, but setting this aside, it seems obviously false that an act motivated the desire to follow what is right, to “be a good person,” is better than one motivated by, for example, empathy. American Philosopher Michael Stocker created an example which demonstrates this point. Imagine you were in the hospital, Stocker said, and one of your friends who subscribed to an obligation-based moral theory came to see you. Throughout the visit, it became clear that they were visiting, not because they care about you, but because they want to be a good person and so this action is required of them. You would be justified in being upset at your friend, and you would probably even view them as a less morally good person than if they had come simply out of concern for you. Discussing his example, Stocker stated, “surely there is something lacking here…in moral merit or value” (The Schizophrenia of Modern Ethical Theories, p. 462). Neither theory, utilitarianism or Kantianism, evaluates motives in a way that seems correct. Motives do matter, but duty is not the only, and not even the best, motivation; this is an additional problem for both theories. Now that application problems and the motives problem have been discussed, the final criterion for comparison remains.

            <h3>Assumptions:</h3>
            <p></p>
            Utilitarianism is based upon the assumption that we ought to do what is best for everyone; there is no justification for this belief within the moral theory. This assumption seems uncontroversial, but it does lead to the conclusion that people shouldn’t act to increase their families and friends’ flourishing over strangers’. Beyond this assumption, that every individual should value the well-being of every other conscious creature, Utilitarianism is for the most part simple in its application: only do any action if it maximizes utility. This is a strength compared to Kantianism.
            While utilitarianism is more simple in its application than Kantianism, one additional consideration has arisen in more recent years: that of non-human animals. Most modern utilitarians claim that, because animals are conscious, their well-being should be taken into account in addition to humans. This claim and its application pose problems, however. Firstly, the question of what is conscious must be taken into account. It seems logical that animals with large brains like elephants and chimpanzees are conscious. It is much less obvious, however, that animals like rats, and even more so ants, flies, and beetles, are conscious at all. We cannot ask animals if they are conscious, and because we have such a poor understanding of how consciousness arises in the brain, we have virtually no way of assessing the extent to which various animals have consciousness. This is an epistemological problem, and therefore is not an issue with utilitarianism as a moral theory as it is a problem with human knowledge more generally. Even so, because of how mysterious consciousness is, it is unlikely that we will ever be able to properly evaluate the consciousness-level of different animals. Even once the utilitarian has (arbitrarily) set the line of what is and is not conscious, the question remains of how much to value some conscious creatures’ experiences over others’. The utilitarian may claim that, because a human is capable of having a deeper, more meaningful life, their well-being should be weighed more heavily than that of animals with lower levels of consciousness. This solution, however, leads to a troubling conclusion. If higher levels of consciousness mean more value in the net flourishing calculation, then people with autism, down syndrome, and other mental disorders’ well-being should be valued less than normally abled peoples’. This conclusion seems like it couldn’t possibly be correct, but if utilitarianism values all creatures, it must either value them all equally, meaning that animals like cats would be worth the same as humans, or it must create a hierarchy of value. Both of these options go against common sense. Importantly, however, a similar issue has arisen in modern Kantianism, when philosophers extend “personhood” to some non-human animals. The same issue exists; it’s unclear what should count as a person. Kantianism does avoid the issue of valuing some humans over others, however, because it views all persons as necessarily deserving to be treated as ends with rights rather than seeking to maximize outcomes for those persons. While modern versions of Kantianism and utilitarianism share this application problem, Kantianism's assumptions are more pervasive throughout the theory: a significant reason why utilitarianism is superior to Kantianism.
            Utilitarianism’s one assumption, that people ought to seek every conscious creature's well-being without higher regard for their own, is unfounded and a problem for the theory. Kantianism, though, has more reliance upon assumptions than utilitarianism. Firstly, Kantianism assumes that the CI is correct without justification. The CI does seem to explain many of our moral intuitions, but that doesn’t make it correct. There is no a priori justification for the CI. This is the most significant issue with Kantianism; there isn’t a strong logic-based reason to believe that the categorical imperative, upon which the entire moral theory rests, is true. Additionally, the application of the CI requires the assumption that what makes an act immoral is a contradiction with the CI. To take the lying example, the reason you shouldn’t lie under Kantianism is not because it will hurt others, and not because it will make the world a worse place, but because it would be contradictory. This is another logical leap necessary for the functioning of the Kantian system, and therefore another mark against the likelihood of Kantianism being correct.
            Both utilitarianism and Kantianism fail to align completely with our moral intuitions. More importantly, they are both also based on unproven assumptions. While neither is perfect,
            Utilitarianism is simpler, more logical, and aligns better with our moral intuitions. Therefore, Utilitarianism is the superior moral theory.
